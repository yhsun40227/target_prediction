This perl script takes a list of miRNA sequences and searches for near-perfect complements in the database using program scan_for_matches, evaluates the miRNA:target complement patterns, calculate minimum free energie ratio (MFE of target:miRNA / MFE of miRNA perfect match) and outputs the prediction results in an easy-to-read html web table format.
